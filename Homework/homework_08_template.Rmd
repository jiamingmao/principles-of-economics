### 1
```{r}
# suppose we use quarterly data
data = read.csv('UNRATE.csv') 
u = ts(data[,2],start=c(2001,1),freq=4) #you need to adjust freq. For example, if you have monthly data, then freq=12
plot(u,xlab="",ylab="Unemployment Rate")
```

### 5
```{r}
# Let's produce a basic connected scatter plot (no arrows, no labels)
# For more advanced/fancy plots, see tutorial: "intro_connected_scatterplot.html"
v = runif(length(u)) # here we randomly generate some v. You need to change this.
plot(u,v,type="o",xy.labels=FALSE,ylab="v",xlab="u") # xy.labels=FALSE gets rid of text labels. 
```
