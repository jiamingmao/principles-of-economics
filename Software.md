## Git and Github

The materials for this course are hosted on `Github` at [github.com/jiamingmao/principles-of-economics](http://www.github.com/jiamingmao/principles-of-economics). Since the course materials are continually updated throughout the semester, it is recommended that you `fork` this repo, and regularly sync it with the original. You can do this using `git` on the command line or using a GUI such as [Github Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/).

[This tutorial](https://github.com/jiamingmao/principles-of-economics/blob/master/Software/Git%20Basics.md) walks you through the steps to do so. If you want to learn more about `git` and `Github`, here are some places to start:

- Code School: [Try Git](https://try.github.io/levels/1/challenges/1)
- Launch School: [A Guide to Git and Github](https://launchschool.com/books/git/)

## R

`R` is a programming language for statistical computing. Throughout the semester, we will be using `R` to conduct basic data analysis to help us apply and better understand the principles and theories we learn in class.

Here are some resources to help you start learning `R`:
- Code School: [Try R](http://tryr.codeschool.com)
- R Core Team, [An Introduction to R](https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/R-intro.html)
- Michonneau, F., [The R Class](http://r-bio.github.io/)
- Burns, P., [The R Inferno](http://www.burns-stat.com/pages/Tutor/R_inferno.pdf)
- [R Programming](https://www.coursera.org/learn/r-programming): a course offered by Johns Hopkins University on Coursera
- [The Data Scientist’s Toolbox](https://www.coursera.org/learn/data-scientists-tools/): another JHU course on Coursera as part of its [data science specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/jhu-data-science), covering topics including `markdown`, `git`, `Github`, `R`, and `Rstudio`

To program in `R`, you need a text editor or an IDE. I recommend `RStudio`. You can download it [here](https://www.rstudio.com/). `RStudio` is a powerful IDE and supports `Git` and `R markdown`. To learn how to use `RStudio` with `Github`, see:
- Bryan, J., [Happy Git and GitHub for the useR](http://happygitwithr.com/)

Once you have a basic command of `R`, I recommend you read this online book:
- Grolemund, G. and H. Wickham, [R for Data Science](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/index.html)

## Markdown

`markdown` is a lightweight markup language for writing documents using an easy-to-read, easy-to-write plain text format, which can then be rendered into `html`, `pdf`, and other formats.

In this course, it is recommended that you write your homework and reports in `markdown` (Why? See [why scholars should write in markdown](http://blogs.harvard.edu/pamphlet/files/2014/08/markdownpost-acmsmall.pdf)).
- [Markdown Tutorial](https://www.markdowntutorial.com/)
- [The Ultimate Guide to Markdown](https://blog.ghost.org/markdown/)

There are many editors you can use to write in `markdown`. For example, you can try the online `markdown` editor [dillinger](https://dillinger.io/), or use a general purpose editor such as [Atom](https://atom.io/).

Or you can use `RStudio`. `RStudio` allows you to write in `R markdown` -- a variant of the `markdown` language that allows you to include `R` codes and automatically generate their output. See:
- [The official R Markdown documentation](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/)
- [Test drive R Markdown](http://stat545.com/block007_first-use-rmarkdown.html)
- Shalizi, C., [Using R Markdown for Class Reports](http://www.stat.cmu.edu/~cshalizi/rmarkdown/)
